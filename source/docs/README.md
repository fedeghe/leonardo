## install leonardo

`> npm install @fedeghe/leonardo`


## use it

First of all in your html include _Leonardo.js_ in the `<head>` tag:  

    <script src="path/to/Leonardo.js"></script>

Now create another `<script>` tag to use _Leonardo.js_:  

```
<script>
    var L = Leonardo (300, 200, {id : "target"});
</script>
```

parameters:  
**width** : the width in pixels (required)
**height** : the height in pixels (required)
attrs : an hash of required attributes for the `<svg>` tag

for _svg namespaces_ is enough just to pass a `ns` element containing an array containing one or more from the following set :
```
['cc', 'dc', 'ev', 'rdf', 'svg', 'xlink']
```
if all are needed is enough to pass '*'.  

But it is better go go in order:
